# wrench

`wrench` is a tool for debugging webrender outside of a browser engine.

## `replay` and `show`

Binary recordings can be generated by webrender and replayed with `wrench replay`. Enable binary recording in `RendererOptions`.

```rust
RendererOptions {
    ...
    enable_recording: true,
    ...
}
```

The recordings will be put in a folder named `record`.

`wrench replay --save yaml` will convert the recording into frames described in yaml. Frames can then be replayed with `wrench show`.

## `reftest`

Wrench also has a reftest system for catching regressions.
* To run reftests use `wrench reftest`.
* To add a new reftest, create an example and a reference frame in `reftests/` and then add an entry to `reftests/reftest.list`
